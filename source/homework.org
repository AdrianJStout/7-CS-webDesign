  1. What role did sir Tim Berners-Lee play in creating the WWW and the mark up language you have been using to create webpages? 
  2. What is a web server?
  3. BEFORE the Internet and the WWW, what did people in the past use to find out information such as business/school phone numbers, movie show times, and what did people do if they want to conduct some research on a holiday destination?
